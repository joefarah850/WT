                      Rodriguez, was an advisor to Mexican President Adolfo Lopez Mateo, and had a 
                      word in his boss’s ear about building a racing circuit in Mexico City’s 
                      Magdalena Mixiuhca sports park using the existing internal roads. El 
                      Presidente liked the idea, and work on the track was completed in under a year.
                      Formula 1 cars arrived in 1962 for a non-championship race, returning the
                      following year for a proper, bona fide Grand Prix. That 1963 race was won by
                      Jim Clark, while for the next few years, Mexico’s fiesta vibes meant it became
                      the traditional season-ender for Formula 1. Mexico was welcomed back onto the F1

                      The track designers took their inspiration from three main circuits: Brooklands in 
                      the UK, Roosevelt Raceway in the USA and Montlhery in France. Buoyed by the success
                      of Brazil’s Emerson Fittipaldi, Formula 1 first jetted into Interlagos for a world
                      championship race in 1973. Fans were treated to a home win in the first three
                      Brazilian Grands Prix, with Fittipaldi victorious in 1973 and 1974, while Carlos
                      Pace won in 1975.`,
